# Week-1
HTML Challenge Week One
Week one of my HTML Coding Challenge was to build Neon Buttons. I found the source code at https://dev.to/somanathgoudar/30dayschallenge-30-days-extreme-html-css-challenge-50k1 . I then modified the code to include tri-color buttons instead of using the pigment fade that the original coder used.
